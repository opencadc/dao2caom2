Application to generate CAOM2 Observations from DAO FITS files.

# How To Run dao2caom2

These are Linux-centric instructions.

In an empty directory (the 'working directory'), on a machine with Docker installed:

1. Set up credentials. The `dao_run*.sh` scripts will attempt to copy $HOME/.ssl/cadcproxy.pem to the 'working directory'.

1. In the master branch of this repository, one time only, find the scripts directory, and copy the file dao_run.sh to the working directory. e.g.:

   ```
   wget https://raw.github.com/opencadc/dao2caom2/master/scripts/dao_run.sh
   ```

1. Ensure the script is executable, one time only:

   ```
   chmod +x dao_run.sh
   ```

1. To run the application:

    ```
    ./dao_run.sh
    ```
    
1. The config.yml file will be created in the 'working directory'. This file controls the execution of the application. See [here](https://github.com/opencadc/collection2caom2/wiki/config.yml) for a description of the entries in this file.

1. To debug the application from inside the container:

   ```
   user@dockerhost:<cwd># docker run --rm -ti -v ${PWD}:/usr/src/app --name dao_run opencadc/dao2caom2 /bin/bash
   root@53bef30d8af3:/usr/src/app# dao_run
   ```

# How to Run dao2caom2 incrementally:

In an empty directory (the 'working directory'), on a machine with Docker installed:

1. In the master branch of this repository, find the scripts directory, and copy the file dao_run_state.sh to the working directory. e.g.:

  ```
  wget https://raw.github.com/opencadc/dao2caom2/master/scripts/dao_run_state.sh
  ```

2. Ensure the script is executable:

```
chmod +x dao_run_state.sh
```

3. To run the application:

```
./dao_run_state.sh
```

Current active instruments/detectors for "DAO" collection.  
I'm ignoring "DAOPLATES" collection which is currently static.
